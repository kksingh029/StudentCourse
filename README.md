# CRUD operations with entities Student and Course that implements many-to-many relationship

## Pre requisites
- \>= Java 8


## Setup Guide
1. Login to your mysql terminal and create mysql database with following command : 
```
  create database admin_university;
```

```
  ./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

If Step 1 and 2 are properly configured, you will see **Tomcat started on port(s): 8000**. Now use the Postman collection mentioned at bottom to explore the APIs.

## Brief Introduction of APIs 
1. There are 8 APIs for student and courses,which contains CRUD for each.
2. JSON for Student as follows : 
```
{
    "name" : "Student A",
    "courses" : [
        {"id" : 1}
    ]
}
```
In above Student JSON, courses field is optional. 

3. JSON for Courses as follows : 
```
{
    "name" : "Course A"
}
```



## Entities are as follows
- Student (id, name)
- Course (id,name)
- An intermediate entity known as student_courses is generated by JPARepository ORM which holds mapping of both tables



## Future Plans
1. To create a generic response (a service layer) for success and failure. 
2. Search through a specific student or course.
3. Lean the Student API, currently all courses are attached with student object who have association with it.
4. Include Pagination.
